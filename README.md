Hello and thanks for interest. This repository contains examples of SQL code I've written for different SQL challenges, feel free to check out. Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualizations I created using Tableau.

**Revenue Visualization on Consumer Behavior dataset** **-** [**Tableau**](https://public.tableau.com/views/RevenueAnalysis_17448916137280/Edition1_0?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 

  - **Data:** [Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset) & [US States Ranked by Population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataanalyst001/us-states-ranked-by-population-2024)
  - **Purpose:** Identify hidden trends and correlation in revenue distribution between different consumer categories and yield

In this dashboard I combined data from two highlighted data sources, even though initial data contains much more categorical data about consumers, I decided to focus on revenue distribution across various groups. Purpose required a creation of few calculation fields in order to be able to differentiate consumers and form a groups. Dashboard gives a deeper understanding about from where and from which groups exactly owner gets more revenue. Crucial point was that we could see the top performing US states compared to their population, often top performers were relatively small states compared to big ones, that generated much lower numbers than expected.
